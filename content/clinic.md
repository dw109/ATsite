Assessments are the foundation of any treatment protocol. Our assessments are full-body, and look to identify dysfunctional as well as painful movement. This is based on the concept that an injury in one part of the body can result from a dysfunction / restriction elsewhere.

Our treatments typically combine manual therapy (massage, soft tissue release, myofascial release, joint mobilizations, muscle energy techniques, PNF stretching), activity modification, and exercise. This approach is guided by the recognition that movement plays a critical role in providing long-lasting results. All clients leave with exercises they can do at home or on their own time.
